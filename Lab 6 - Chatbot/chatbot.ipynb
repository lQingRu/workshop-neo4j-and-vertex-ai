    "1. __Grounding for more complex question handling__: Multi-hop knowledge retrieval across connected data. Connections between data points are calculated before query time. \n",
    "2. __Enterprise reliability and security__: Fine-grained security so the chatbot only accesses information the user has permission to. Autonomous clustering for horizontal scaling.  Fully managed service in the cloud through Aura. \n",
    "3. __Performance__: fast queries with high concurrency for many users.\n",

    "## Semantic Layers\n",
    "The Text to Cypher approach we just did above can be brittle due to the indeterministic nature of models. For Production, you might need to be more deterministic and robust. [Semantic Layers approach](https://github.com/neo4j-partners/neo4j-generative-ai-google-cloud/blob/main/assetmanager/ui/streamlit/semantic_layer/semantic_fn.py) is more suitable here. It leverages on Tooling or Function-calling capabilities of LLMs. So, user queries can be directed to relevant templated cypher queries via function-calling. This way, no Cypher gets geenrated by the LLM. Instead, user's intent and query parameters are captured and directed to the relevant templated cypher code."

    "## Fine Tuning for Cypher Generation\n",
    "We encourage you to use Vertex AI Gemini family models with a schema, few-shot examples, and precise prompt engineering for Cypher generation. However, if that still doesn't provide an appropriate level of quality, or you need your LLM to improve accuracy on a more specific task area, you can try fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is the process of taking a foundational model and making precise changes to improve its performance for a specific, narrower task. It works by taking in training data containing many examples of your specific task and using it to update or add additional parameters in a new version of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total training time generally takes more than an hour. The tuned adapter model is going to stay within your tenant, and your training data will not be used to train the base model, which is frozen. Tuning runs on GCP's TPU infrastructure that is optimized to run ML workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data should be structured as a supervised training set, where each row contains input text and desired, resulting, Cypher query. Vertex AI expects you to adhere to the below format in a `jsonl` file.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we went through the steps of connecting a LangChain agent to a Neo4j database and using it to generate Cypher queries in response to user requests via LLMs on Vertex AI, thus grounding the LLM with a knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we used the `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-1.5-pro` models here, this approach can be generalized to other Vertex AI LLMs.  This process can also be augmented with additional steps around the generation chain to customize the experience for specific use cases.  \n",
